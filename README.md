Project Management Tool
=======================

Information
-----------

PM tool is designed to be a basic project management tool. It's only contains most essential parts of project management such as managing users and their roles on created projects, assigning tasks and tracking the overall progress.

Since most of the good PM alternatives were written in Ruby and Java, we started to develop one with PHP to enable ease of maintenance for PHP developers.

Built on [Scabbia Framework 1.5](https://github.com/larukedi/Scabbia-Framework).
